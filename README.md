## Goal of the project

The monitoring equipment endpoints provide a snapshot of all the drones within a 500 by 500 meter square and are updated about once every 2 seconds.
The no-fly zone is a circle with a 100 meter radius, origin at position 250000,250000.

Build and deploy a web application which lists all the drone pilots who recently violated the no fly zone.

## Technologies used

The project is built with React + Node.js. Node-Cache was chosen over a database for storing pilots information for it's lightweigth, fast and temporary nature. ReactQuery is used as a preferred technology for fetching and rendering the data over commonly used useEffect to comply with the newest React documentation.

### Client:

- React
- TypeScript
- ReactQuery

### Server

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Express
- Fast-Xml-Parser
- Node-Cache

## How to run locally

1. Git clone repository
2. Follow steps in client and server README files.
